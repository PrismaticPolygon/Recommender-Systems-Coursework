# Recommender-Systems-Coursework

Develop a context-aware recommender system (CARS) music application. 

Material for Web Technologies can be re-used. 

Context: select a single context (e.g. mood) from the contextual information collected in the dataset.
Dataset: [MusicMicro](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/musicmicro/index.html). Much simpler than #nowplaying-RS.

Research, select, justify, and apply to your system techniques for:
* Feature extraction and selection (consider user data, item data, and context)
* 2D / MD recommender techniue (user profiling/modelling)
* Contextual recommendation generation: contextual information filtering / modelling (e.g. pre- or post-filtering, neural collaborative filtering)

UI: develop a simple UI for your application. This can be a Python script. Showcase:
* how does the system recognise the active user? Which user data is gathered - explicit / implicit?
* Output: how are recommendations and/or predictions presented to the user?
